# TypeIT

This is my first project with using TypeScript. 

The goal of this project is to help the user practice touch typing. At the moment, the user is presented with 2 modes for learning - printing words and printing sentences (several languages are presented).

There is also a settings section for the user, where he can customize the applications to suit his needs and train more efficiently.

## Hot keys

#### Enter

Reset current try

#### Esc

Open settings
